# My Burger App - Using Node Express Handlebars

## Description:
This repository provides the landing page for my burger app. This burger app allows you to place an order and then devour your desired burgers. 

Due to limited time, I wasn't able to create a visually pleasing app, instead I've chosen a cheddar-cheese colored background. I do plan to update this to be more aesthetically pleasing in the near future, however, this time around I was focused purely on functionality. 

Please click the link here to access my [repository](https://github.com/floressuarezalvaro/burger). I've also uploaded my app on Heroku [here](https://github.com/floressuarezalvaro/burger).  Below is a video of how my team generator works.
